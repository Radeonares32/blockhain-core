# Budlum Blockchain Core

**Budlum Core** is a production-grade, modular blockchain framework written in Rust. It serves as a high-performance Layer-1 blockchain featuring pluggable consensus engines (PoW, PoS, PoA), a hardened libp2p-based networking stack, and an atomic, account-based state model.

The architecture emphasizes **security**, **modularity**, and **readability**, making it an ideal foundation for custom blockchain networks or educational study of advanced distributed ledger technology. With the latest Mainnet Hardening phases, the framework is incredibly robust against spam, DDOS, and chain manipulation.

## 🛡️ Mainnet Hardening Features

The Budlum blockchain has undergone massive security sweeping and optimization phases, making it ready for production environments.

- **Granular Token-Bucket Rate Limiting**: The Peer Manager assigns dedicated burst capacities for Votes (Finality) and Blobs (QC), strictly dropping messages and punishing peers that attempt to flood consensus-heavy traffic.
- **VRF-Based Leader Selection (PoS)**: Replaced RANDAO with **Verifiable Random Functions**. Leaders derive lottery outcomes and proofs from their private keys and slots, making elections immune to bias and providing DoS resistance via hidden leadership.
- **Strict Network Isolation & Handshake Gating**: Nodes executing handshakes enforce `chain_id` checks immediately. Furthermore, the networking layer explicitly drops un-handshaked packets (i.e., unsolicited block or transaction floods) before allocation.
- **Genesis Spoofing Ban**: Any transaction arriving into the mempool, or network block >0 proposing a transaction acting as `from: "genesis"`, is strictly rejected prior to propagation.
- **Universal Transaction Validation**: Signatures are evaluated at every touchpoint before advancing into execution arrays. The block processing loop mandates intrinsic `tx.chain_id == block.chain_id` verifications.
- **Strict State Determinism**: Account block applications (`apply_block`) execute in a rigid boundary, actively propagating nested transaction failures to reject the entire network block payload. Node startups will intentionally execute a secure "hard crash" exit upon intercepting disk-level state corruption.
- **Deterministic Serialization**: Migrated from `serde_json` to `bincode` for state root hashing and block slashing evidence to guarantee deterministic byte mappings matching `BlockHeader` hashes. Integrated `prost`-based Protobuf schemas for all P2P payloads.
- **Panic Vector Eradication**: Mutex locks spanning heavy traffic surfaces (`Arc<Mutex<Blockchain>>` and `PeerManager`) are routed through graceful `.unwrap_or_else` boundaries to terminate connections instead of propagating poisoned lock panics across the async runtime.
- **Background Maintenance Workers**: Features automated background asynchronous loops ticking via `tokio::time::interval`, running Mempool Garbage Collection (TTL-based expiration), Peer Manager expired ban cleanup, and continuous Kademlia DHT peer discovery (bootstrap loops) to ensure memory health.
- **BLS Finality Layer**: A two-phase voting protocol (Prevote/Precommit) provides deterministic finality. Once 2/3 of validators produce a `FinalityCert`, the block is immutable, and the fork-choice rule strictly forbids reorgs past finalized checkpoints.
- **Optimistic QC & PQ Attestation**: Integrated **Dilithium** (NIST-standard Post-Quantum) signatures for attestation. Signatures are bundled into Merkle tree `QcBlob` artifacts, verifiable via compact **Fraud Proofs** without bloating the main chain.
- **Finality-Aware Disk Pruning**: The pruning engine respects finalized checkpoints. Sled DB purges block data only beneath the finalized height, ensuring historical integrity for all confirmed states.
- **Robust Network Handshake**: Handshakes now exchange `validator_set_hash` and `supported_schemes` (BLS, Dilithium), isolating protocol-incompatible nodes immediately.
- **Deterministic Serialization**: Migrated to `prost`-based Protobuf schemas for P2P payloads. Bincode is used for sensitive consensus artifacts (Slashing, VRF) to guarantee bit-exact hashing across heterogeneous architectures.

## 🔍 Core Components Deep Dive

### 1. Data Structures

The fundamental primitives of the Budlum blockchain are **Blocks** and **Transactions**.

#### Block (`src/block.rs`)
A block contains a header and a body of transactions.
- **`index`**: height of the block (genesis = 0).
- **`hash`**: SHA3-256 hash of the block content.
- **`previous_hash`**: Link to the parent block.
- **`producer`**: Ed25519 Public Key of the node that created the block.
- **`signature`**: Ed25519 Signature of the block hash by the producer. (Placebo `stake_proof` implementations were purged to enforce pure intrinsic signature validation).
- **`chain_id`**: Network identifier to prevent cross-chain replay.
- **`transactions`**: A vector of `Transaction` objects.

#### Transaction (`src/transaction.rs`)
A state-changing directive signed by a wallet.
- **`from`/`to`**: Ed25519 Public Keys (Hex).
- **`nonce`**: Sequence number. Must strictly increment (0, 1, 2...) for valid processing.
- **`signature`**: Signs `hash(from, to, amount, fee, nonce, data, chain_id)`.
- **Atomic Execution**: If any transaction fails cryptographic checks (or has invalid bounds for timestamp +15 seconds past server time), the execution fails.

---

### 2. Consensus Engines

Budlum abstracts consensus into the `ConsensusEngine` trait.

#### Proof of Stake (PoS) & VRF (`src/consensus/pos.rs`)
- **Selection**: Uses Verifiable Random Functions for unbiased, secure proposers. Thresholding is proportional to stake, ensuring fairness.
- **Slashing**: Detects **Double-Proposals** and **Double-Signatures**.

#### BLS Finality Layer (`src/consensus/finality.rs`)
- **BFT Consensus**: Adds a gadget on top of PoS to finalize blocks via aggregate signatures.
- **Checkpoints**: Every 100 blocks, a mandatory quorum vote seals the chain's past forever.

#### Optimistic QC (`src/consensus/qc.rs`)
- **Post-Quantum Security**: Implements Dilithium-based attestations.
- **Fraud Proofs**: Nodes can challenge invalid PQ attestations by submitting Merkle proofs of invalid signatures.

#### Proof of Work (PoW) (`src/consensus/pow.rs`)
- **Algorithm**: Standard SHA3-256 Hashcash.
- **Validation**: Ensures blocks compute properly, and `cumulative difficulty` overrides trivial chain lengths for more sophisticated fork choices. Adaptive retargeting applies block delays.

#### Proof of Authority (PoA) (`src/consensus/poa.rs`)
- **Permissioned**: Only keys in `validators.json` can sign.
- **Round-Robin**: Validators produce blocks in a strict rotation (`height % validator_count`).

---

### 3. Mempool & Anti-Spam (`src/mempool.rs`)

A structured transaction pool with advanced spam protection.

#### Features
- **Fee-Based Ordering**: Transactions sorted by fee (highest first).
- **Replace-By-Fee (RBF)**: Higher-fee tx replaces same-nonce tx (+10% bump required).
- **Anti-Spam Rules**:
  - Max 16 pending transactions per sender.
  - Minimum fee enforcement.
  - Duplicate rejection.
- **TTL Expiration**: Stale transactions auto-removed.

---

### 4. Genesis & Monetary Policy (`src/genesis.rs`)

Deterministic genesis block (TIMESTAMP = 0) and economic parameters.

#### GenesisConfig
```rust
GenesisConfig {
    chain_id: 1337,
    allocations: vec![("address", amount)],  // Initial balances
    validators: vec!["pubkey1", "pubkey2"],  // Initial validators
    block_reward: 50,
    base_fee: 1,
}
```

#### Economic Constants
- `BLOCK_REWARD`: 50 BDLM per block
- `BASE_FEE`: 1 BDLM minimum transaction fee

---

### 4. Networking Layer

Budlum uses the **libp2p** stack to ensure robust, decentralized peer-to-peer communication.

#### Sync Protocol & Reorg Orchestration
Headers-first synchronization for efficient chain sync and fork-resolution:
- `GetHeaders` / `Headers`: Multi-step exponential locators calculate accurate fork-points.
- `BlocksRange`: Rapid batch delivery mechanisms matching chain height.
- `try_reorg()`: Evaluates cumulative difficulty and automates local chain truncations to adopt the heaviest canonical chain without node freezes.
- `GetStateSnapshot` / `SnapshotChunk`: State snapshot sync.

#### Protocol Messages
Defined in `src/network/protocol.rs` and `proto/protocol.proto`:
- `Handshake` / `HandshakeAck`: Protocol version and validator set hash verification.
- `Block(Block)` / `Transaction(Transaction)`: Core data propagation.
- **Finality**: `Prevote`, `Precommit`, and `FinalityCert` (BLS-aggregated).
- **QC**: `GetQcBlob` and `QcBlobResponse` (Dilithium-indexed).

#### Serialization & Efficiency
Budlum has migrated to **Protobuf** for P2P messaging to ensure minimal overhead and cross-language compatibility. Determinisitic serialization for consensus state uses **Bincode**.

#### DoS Protection: Peer Scoring
To prevent spam and attacks, the `PeerManager` (`src/network/peer_manager.rs`) assigns scores and Token-Bucket capacities:
- **Valid Block**: +1
- **Invalid Block**: -20
- **Oversized Message / Spam**: Rate Limited Token Deductions / Bans
- **Ban Threshold**: -100 (1 Hour Ban)

---

### 5. State Management

Budlum uses an Account-based model (like Ethereum), not UTXO (like Bitcoin).

#### Storage (`src/storage.rs`)
Data is persisted in **sled**, a high-performance embedded database.
- **`BLOCK:{hash}`**: Stores serialized block data.
- **`LAST`**: Stores the hash of the chain tip.
- **`SNAPSHOT:{height}`**: Stores compressed `AccountState`.

#### Snapshots & Pruning (`src/snapshot.rs`)
- **Snapshot Loop**: Every 1000 blocks, the node saves a snapshot of all balances.
- **Pruning**: Blocks older than `2 * max_reorg_depth` (200 blocks) can be pruned to save disk space, as long as a valid snapshot exists ahead of them.

---

### 6. Cryptography & Security

#### Standards
- **Signatures**:
    - **Ed25519**: Primary signature for transactions and basic block identity.
    - **BLS (bls12_381)**: Multi-signature aggregation for finality voting.
    - **Dilithium**: Post-Quantum attestation for long-term security.
- **Hashing**: **SHA3-256** (Keccak).
- **Proof of Possession (PoP)**: Mandated for BLS key registration to prevent rogue-key attacks.

#### Domain Separation
We prefix all hashes to prevent context confusion attacks.
- Block Hash Prefix: `BDLM_BLOCK_V2` (includes state_root)
- TX Hash Prefix: `BDLM_TX_V1`
- State Root Prefix: `BDLM_STATE_V1`

#### Chain ID
Every transaction is signed with a specific `chain_id`.
- Mainnet: `1`
- Testnet: `42`
- Devnet: `1337`
This ensures a transaction meant for Testnet cannot be replayed on Mainnet.
